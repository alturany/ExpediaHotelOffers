Notes:

1) localization should be done 

2) I have invested into crafting a generic URI builder

3)  tried to use APIs to simplify my code as much as possible

4) since I had no experience in almost all technologies, that has leaded to:
 a) it took me much more longer time than your estimation.
 b) basic scenarios testing has been done; no in depth testing.
 c) search form is primitive, date picker should has been used instead of date fields
 d) results page is very primitive.
